This project is a basic management system created primarily to practice and understand:

- JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts — defining classes, methods, inheritance, and encapsulation

- How to use ES6 modules — exporting and importing functions, classes, and variables between files

- Organizing code in a modular way for better readability and maintainability
